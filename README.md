# Sunshine-Cat-Platformer
Simple level of a game made in Unity for CS 4474 (Game Engine Development)

This is a game inspired by the secret levels in Super Mario Sunshine. 
Basically, use WASD to look around and move, and SPACE to jump. Your goal is to reach the end "flagpost".  
There's a triple jump mechanic which makes your third consecutive jump (within a certain time) more powerful.  
You lose a life if you fall into the void. Green platforms are checkpoints. Touching one will set that platform as your respawn point.  
You can optionally turn off lives and checkpoints from the main menu.  
There's only one level; the three buttons on the main menu are there for show.  

It uses Unity, which I was learning at the time.  
The first scene that should be loaded is Setup.  

I had to remove the music and jump sounds because I just took them from Super Mario Sunshine.
